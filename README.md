# CapstoneProject

<b>
This is Solo Team Capstone project as a requirements for the Data Science Bootcamp/Course graduation.
</b>

<!-- 
This project is made in partial fulfillment of the Service Design Innovation Project for my master degree. The student data is from the University of Maastricht (UM). Do note that this piece of code is part one of four for the entire project. However, since the purpose of this github account is to serve as my portfolio and proof of my coding capabilities, I will only include code that I have personally written. With that being said, this piece of code is made by me and another group member, Robbert Lalisang.
